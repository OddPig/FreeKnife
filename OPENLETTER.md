*This is an open letter to Cricut Inc.*

Hello, and thanks for checking out this project!

I built this project to help with my specific use case: First: I wanted to easily use my Cricut offline, without any account. Second, I wanted to more easily itterate on cutting SVG-based files rather than repeatedly re-uploading to Design Space.

This project is not a threat to your services business model. To use this software, somebody has to download it from Github (which is not non-programmer friendly), figure out how to extract AES keys, accept the "doom and gloom" warnings this software presents, navigate this software's weird UI (which I deliberately made dark and vaguely hacker-y), and supply SVGs that they've created in some other software package (Some of this might improve over time, but it won't improve by much). And that's assuming that this program doesn't crash first. **The demographic who will tolerate all this is not the same as the demographic who is going to pay you a subscription for services.** This is software for tinkerers and people with ideological opinions about free software. It is not designed to compete with your services business (It's also GPL licensed, which is a poison pill for anybody *else* looking to use this commercially).

So yeah, you could break all of this by pushing a firmware update to every cricut device with a new or modified communications protocol. But honestly, it's not worth your dev and QA time.

So don't worry!

Thanks,
